This project reads the spesific named text as 
“text.txt” ,and maps all chars into a map type convert them 
into a priority queue with HuffmanNode type which is defined 
in HuffManHeap.h And creating a huffman tree after that with using 
that tree finding and storing the codes for each unique char into a
map.Finally Writing the huffman codes and ascii codes into seperate
text files named “huffman.txt” and “ascii.txt” and printing them in
screen.
